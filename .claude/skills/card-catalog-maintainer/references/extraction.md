# Extraction and versioning reference

How to turn issuer wording into data fields. The schema in `schema/card.schema.json` and the vocabularies in
`vocab/` are authoritative; this file explains how to read the pages.

## General

- Extract only from the text fetched in this run. Do not fill a field from memory, from another card, or
  from a lead.
- Prefer the most specific issuer document: benefit terms or the Guide to Benefits over the marketing page,
  and the rates-and-fees page for fees. Cite the page where the number actually appears.
- Money is a decimal string with two places (`"895.00"`). Rates are decimal strings (`"5"`, `"1.5"`).
- `notes` is your own short paraphrase. Quote at most a few words, only when the exact wording decides a
  field (for example "plus applicable taxes").

## Fees

| Wording                                           | Field                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Annual Fee: $X"                                  | `annual_fee: "X"`                                        |
| "$0 intro annual fee for the first year, then $X" | `first_year_annual_fee: "0.00"`, `annual_fee: "X"`       |
| "$X for each authorized user" / "Additional Card" | `authorized_user_fee: "X"`; `null` if the page is silent |
| Business: "Employee Cards: $X each" or no fee     | `authorized_user_fee: "X"` or `"0.00"`                   |
| "No foreign transaction fees"                     | `foreign_transaction_fee_percent: "0"`                   |
| "N% of each transaction after conversion to USD"  | `foreign_transaction_fee_percent: "N"`                   |

Promotional or targeted fee offers are not fees; ignore them.

## Earn rates

- Map the category to `vocab/earn-categories.json`. If nothing fits, do not invent a category: leave the
  rule out and flag it in the pull request.
- Channel: "booked directly with" → `direct`; "through <issuer> Travel" or the issuer's portal →
  `issuer_portal`; both named → both channels.
- "on up to $X per calendar year" → `cap: { amount: "X", period: "annual", reset_basis: "calendar" }`;
  "each quarter" → `period: "quarterly"`. `rate_after_cap` only when the page states it, else `null`.
- "U.S. supermarkets", "U.S. gas stations" → `region: "US"` on the condition, same category.
- Business caps such as "on the first $X in combined purchases in these categories each account anniversary
  year" → one `cap` with `reset_basis: "anniversary"` and `shared_with` listing the rules that share it.
- Put channel, merchant, region, activation and prepaid conditions inside each earn version
  (`earn_rates[].versions[].conditions`), not on the rule itself.
- Detailed rotating schedules and top-spend selection are deferred in Phase 1. Do not emit unsupported
  fields; flag these rules for schema review before adding the affected cards.
- Points versus cash comes from the product's `rewards.unit`; a page saying "5% cash back" on a points card
  is a mismatch to flag, not to fix.

- Cadence stated without boundaries ("each quarter") → calendar periods with `period_boundaries:
"inferred"`.
- Pick `category` from `vocab/credit-categories.json`.
- New credits need at least one `match.keywords` entry: the brand or program name in uppercase (`RESY`,
  `STUBHUB`). Never use text from anyone's statement.
- A real eligibility change (for example a new minimum stay) creates a new version, even if only notes
  can express it. Only editorial corrections are in-place notes updates.

## Versioning

For initial terms with no established historical start, use `effective_from: null` and
`effective_from_basis: "unknown"`. Do not invent a start from a migration or verification date.

When a value or eligibility condition of a current version changes:

1. Determine the new start date. If the page states it, use it with `effective_from_basis: "stated"`.
   Otherwise use today's date with `effective_from_basis: "detected"`, and state in the pull request the
   window in which the change happened: after the old version's `last_verified`, on or before today.
2. Set the old version's `effective_to` to the day before the new start. Leave every other field of the old
   version as it is.
3. Append the new version with `status: "verified"`, `source`, `last_verified: today` and a `notes`
   paraphrase.
4. If the new value is not readable, append the new version with `status: "to_verify"` and `amount: null`
   (or `rate: null` / `annual_fee: null`) instead of guessing. Optional fee fields may remain null
   on an otherwise verified fee version; explain the gaps.

When a future change is announced (stated start date after today), add the new version now with that
`effective_from` and close the current version the day before; the data stays correct on both sides of the
date.

Re-verification without a value change only updates `last_verified` on versions whose values you found in
the fetched text.
